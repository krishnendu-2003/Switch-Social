# Switch-Social

A small insight our project:

So what is Switch-Social ??
Switch-Social is web3 platform for content creation and consumption with a focus on DRM, where creators earn cryptocurrency and consumers enjoy a secure, engaging experience.

How are we planning to get through the various problems?

Content Ownership: Ensures creators retain control over their intellectual property and prevents unauthorized use.
Monetization: Provides creators with a direct revenue stream through cryptocurrency based on user interactions.
Transparency: Uses blockchain for clear ownership records and transparent transactions.
Engagement: Enhances consumer interaction with content through likes, shares, and comments.
Security: Leverages blockchain to protect against data breaches and fraud.
Fair Compensation: Directly rewards creators based on engagement, promoting fairer revenue distribution.
